An effective approach to learning
Thanks to the use of digital technologies, the learning process is effective and exciting for all students

A profitable and safe method
The simulator will be a safe replacement for a real drone, which will allow you not to worry about the risk of damage to property or injury.
Our team consists of four talented specialists who are developing a VR simulator for training drone pilots. Each of us contributes uniquely to the project, ensuring its success and innovation.

### Our Solutions:
- Realistic Simulation: We have developed highly accurate models of drones and their behavior to provide the most realistic training experience.
- Interactive Scenarios: Our training programs include a variety of scenarios that help pilots develop skills in different conditions and situations.
- Analytics and Feedback: We have implemented an analytics system that tracks pilots' progress and provides detailed feedback to improve their skills.
